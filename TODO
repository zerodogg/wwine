TODO list for wwine in no particular order.

--auto,-a mode. Autodetect and autocreate bottles depending
on the location of the file.

--wrap mode. Create an automatic wrapper script around a
command, so that an entire wwine command does not have to
be repeated.

Fall back to attempts to detect various wine flavours
if no --wine was supplied.
