wwine (wrapped wine) is a a wine wrapper. It wraps various flavours of wine
(including vanilla wine and crossover office/games) into a single
unified interface, complete with full bottle support for all
of them (including vanilla wine).

It integrates well with all flavours, so for instance applications
installed using crossover will be managable through the usual crossover
interface.

For vanilla wine it uses WINEPREFIX to achieve bottle support,
creating bottles as ~/.winebottle_[BOTTLE_NAME].
